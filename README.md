# Impact of Air Quality on MTA Ridership in NYC üóΩüçé
Understanding the connection between public transportation and the air we breathe is crucial because it directly impacts our daily lives and health. Public transportation, like buses and subways, can help reduce the number of cars on the road, which in turn can lower pollution levels. Cleaner air means fewer health problems, especially for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.

### Problem Statement:
*"How does air quality impact public transportation usage in New York City, and what implications does this have for city planning and public health without losing efficacy?"*

### Objective:
To investigate the relationship between air quality and MTA ridership to provide insights for improving public health and sustainable city planning.

### Key Findings 

## Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates that data science can significantly contribute to optimizing public transportation in NYC, with the potential to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, and maintain or even enhance service efficacy. By leveraging predictive models and data-driven insights, NYC can make informed decisions that promote sustainable urban mobility and better meet the needs of its residents.

These insights and models provide a foundation for more sustainable transportation planning, aligning with broader environmental goals and ensuring that public transportation remains a reliable and efficient option for city dwellers.

### Challenges

* **Data Availability and Quality:**
Incomplete or Missing Data: Some datasets may have missing values or incomplete records, which can hinder analysis and model accuracy. For example, gaps in pollution data or ridership statistics can lead to less reliable correlations and predictions.

* **Multifactorial Influences:**
Subway ridership is influenced by a wide range of factors beyond pollution, such as weather, socio-economic conditions, and public events. Accurately modeling these complex interactions is challenging, particularly when data on all relevant factors is not available.

* **Lag in Data Availability:**
There may be delays in obtaining or processing real-time data, which can affect the timeliness and accuracy of model predictions. This can be especially problematic for dynamic adjustments to public transportation routes.
  
### Recommendations

* **Targeting Pollution Hotspots:**
Prioritize route optimization in areas with high NO2 and CO levels to reduce emissions and improve air quality.

* **Focus on Income and Population Density:** 
While direct correlations weren't established, it's likely that neighborhoods with lower incomes and higher population densities rely more on public transport. Optimizing routes in these areas can enhance service effectiveness and ensure equitable access.

* **Balancing Service and Environmental Goals:** 
The challenge is to maintain or improve public transport services while reducing emissions. Data science can help by identifying under-utilized routes or suggesting alternative modes of transport.

* **Dynamic Service Adjustments:**
Use predictive models to adjust service levels in real-time, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently based on predicted ridership and pollution levels.

* **Integrate Real-Time Data:** 
Incorporate real-time traffic, air quality, and event data into predictive models for more responsive and accurate transportation adjustments.

* **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback:** 
Establish a feedback loop through continuous monitoring of pollution and ridership, allowing data to inform real-time decisions, such as increasing public transport options when air quality deteriorates.
